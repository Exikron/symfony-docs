How to Use the Apache Router
============================

.. caution::

    **Using the Apache Router is no longer considered a good practice**.
    The small increase obtained in the application routing performance is not
    worth the hassle of continuously updating the routes configuration.

    Apache router was deprecated in Symfony 2.5 and removed in Symfony 3.0.
    Since the PHP implementation of the Router was improved, performance gains
    were no longer significant (while it's very hard to replicate the same
    behavior).
